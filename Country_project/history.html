    <h2>From Ancient Civilizations to a Modern Kingdom</h2>


    <p>
        The Arabian Peninsula has been home to tribes, trade routes, and ancient civilizations
        for thousands of years. Long before the rise of Islam, Arabia was a crossroads of culture,
        linking Africa, Asia, and Europe.

    <h3>Early Civilizations</h3>
    <p>
        Regions like AlUla, Najran, and the eastern coast hosted thriving ancient communities.  
        The famous Nabateans built stone cities such as <strong>Hegra</strong>, which is now a UNESCO World Heritage site.
    </p>


    <h3>The Birth of Islam (7th Century)</h3>
    <p>
        In 610 CE, Prophet Muhammad received the first revelation in Mecca, leading to the birth of Islam.  
        Within decades, the Arabian tribes united under the new religion, shaping the region for centuries.

    <h3>The First and Second Saudi States</h3>
    <p>
        The Al Saud family established the first Saudi state in 1744, followed by a second in the 19th century.  
        These early states laid the foundation for the modern nation.
